# Welcome!

So, you want to be a developer huh? Well I am willing to help you reach your goals. I have to start by telling ypu that being a developer is a difficult, long time cultivating with effort activity but as much as any other career, I am just trying to be honset with you, being a developer require you to be open to learn new things and continue to study your whole live, if you don´t find joy on it I thought you would like to know it in advance.

As of 2019 becoming a developer (and a good one ) does not require to go to college or pay expensive tuition, instead it requires power of will, an internet connection and the ability to be open to change your mindset regarding the world you live in, how exciting does that sound?.

If you still continue reading it means you want to know more and start learning the things that will make you a developer so I will get inmediately to business, The first thing I want you to learn what GIT is. Please watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c).

I just need this first step to make you understand that despite what movies show us developers
 are not lonely creatures, instead we love to communicate to others all the time, the thing isthat
 it might be true that we don´t do it the way everybody else does it, we like to be able to remember all the conversations we had and since we know we are not special humans we make computers do that for us, we make real efforts for making sure we save all the knowledge and information we generate and adquire no matter what it takes (and real good developers are master at it). We also love the fact that we can do our work from wherever we like /want if not look at [this picture](https://github.com/diegoseso/new-developer-career-path/while-writting.jpg) I took while I was writing this.

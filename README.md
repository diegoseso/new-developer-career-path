# Welcome!

So, you want to be a developer, huh? Well, I am willing to help you reach your goals. I have to start by telling you that being a developer is a difficult, long time cultivating with effort activity but just as much as any other career, I am just trying to be honest with you, being a developer require you to be open to learn new things and continue to study your whole life, if you don't find joy on it I thought you would like to know it in advance.

As of 2019 becoming a developer (and a good one) does not require to go to college or pay expensive tuition, instead, it requires a power of will, an internet connection and the ability to be open to change your mindset regarding the world you live in. How exciting does that sound?

If you still continue reading it means you want to know more and start learning the things that will make you a developer. So, I will get immediately to business. The first thing I want you to learn is what GIT is. Please watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c).

I just need this first step to make you understand that despite what movies show us, developers are not lonely creatures. Instead, we love to communicate with others all the time. The thing is that it might be true that we don't do it the way everybody else does. We like to be able to remember all the conversations we had and, since we know we are not special humans, we make computers do that for us. We make real efforts for making sure we save all the knowledge and information we generate and acquire, no matter what it takes (and really good developers are master at it). We also love the fact that we can do our work from wherever we like/want. If not, look at [this picture](https://github.com/diegoseso/new-developer-career-path/while-writting.jpg) I took while I was writing this. 

I will also like you to read the following [article](https://simpleprogrammer.com/software-development-career-paths/), here it is explained what are the developer's career paths.


## What is GitHub?

GitHub is now the largest online storage space of collaborative works that exists in the world. At the heart of GitHub is Git, an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Git, like other version control systems, manages and stores revisions of projects. Although it’s mostly used for code, Git could be used to manage any other type of file, such as Word documents or Final Cut projects. Think of it as a filing system for every draft of a document.

The flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.

These three features – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful. if you wanted to contribute to an open source project you had to manually download the project’s source code, make your changes locally, create a list of changes called a “patch” and then e-mail the patch to the project’s maintainer. The maintainer would then have to evaluate this patch, possibly sent by a total stranger, and decide whether to merge the changes.

To understand how it works, take a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E).

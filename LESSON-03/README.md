# Introduction 

On this Lesson we will learn all about control structures and loops, 
basically we will be learning how to take decisions inside the code and 
running once same piece of code once and again, surprisingly as it sounds 
repeating execution of code is one of the most useful things available in code.

# 3. Control structures and Loops

## 3.1 If statement.

An if statement is a programming conditional statement that, if proved true,
performs a function or displays information. Below is a general example of an if statement, not specific to any particular

    if (X < 10) {
     print "Hello John";
    }  

In the example above, if the value of X were equal to any number less than 10, the program would print, or display, "Hello John" on the console when the script is run
